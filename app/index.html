          <p>
            I have been working as a Web Developer since 2004. I am currently working as a front-end engineer freelancer. I moved to Dublin this year to look for an opportunity in Europe. My last work experience was at Elo7, a marketplace of handmade products based in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time, I was also a teacher at DRC training center, an IT school in São Paulo. My strongest skill is client-side front-end development. And my main domains are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, Compass and AngularJS. On the server-side I usually code in Java and PHP.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also use GIT for version control, GruntJS to automate tasks and tests with Ruby(rSpec) and Jenkins. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Information Systems.
